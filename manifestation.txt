I was working on an ad with a table of top pharma companies.
Anshul asked me to make a duplicate of the same ad and remove the table, 
replace it with only the companies logos.
So i started on the new ad, made a new copy and distributed the logos,
removed the table already. so i wanted to look back the old ad table to take the company names.
The moment when i pan the cursor back to the previous ad and table area,
On my personal laptop it was playing an tamil horoscope video on youtube. On that video, the 
author was mentioning 'INTHA ATTAVAIYA NEENGA PAATHEENGANNA THERIYUM'... 
i was literally stunned hearing that word, 'Attavanai' because, i was looking at the table on ad.
Is it coinsedence or manifestation.
